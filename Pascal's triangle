//Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The first few rows of Pascal's Triangle look like this:
//    1
//   1 1
//  1 2 1
// 1 3 3 1
//1 4 6 4 1
//Each number in the triangle represents a combination of the row number and the position of the number in that row. For example, the number "6" in the fifth row is the 
//combination of selecting 2 items out of 4 items (from the row number). It is often used in combinatorics and probability. Write a C++ code to draw a pascal's triangle.
