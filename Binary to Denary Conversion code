//Q. Write a C++ program code that prompts the user to enter a binary number and then outputs its decimal form. For eg, user enters '1010' and output is 10.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int bn, sum = 0;
	cout << "Enter the binary number: ";
	cin >> bn;

	int i = 1;
	while (bn != 0)
	{
		if (bn % 10 == 1)
		{
			sum += i;
		}
		bn /= 10;
		i = i * 2;
	}
	cout << "The decimal form is " << sum;
}
