//A triangular number is a number that can be represented as a triangle with dots. For example, 1, 3, 6, 10, etc., are triangular numbers. Write a code that checks if the input number
//can be represented as a triangular number or not. If it can, it prints "Triangular"; otherwise, it prints "Not triangular".
